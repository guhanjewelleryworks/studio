## Original User Request:
Create an app similar to uber where users will be able to find nearby goldsmith & can place their gold ornament orders.
Also goldsmiths who'll be  our partner should have a different dedicated source website where they receive orders just like uber drivers receive ride requests.
And one more for me to handle both Goldsmiths & customers accounts & details just like how uber has

Do this using NodeJS & ReactJS

App / website should be very appealing as per gold purchasing customers fell
